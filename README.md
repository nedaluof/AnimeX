## ‚õ©Ô∏è Tech stack
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
    + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/)
      for asynchronous tasks.
- Jetpack
    - [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
        - Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states based on the lifecycle changes.
        - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data.
        - DataBinding: support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data
          sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
        - Room: used to construct reliable caching for offline support.
        - [Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)
          helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over
          the
          network.
        - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): for DI (dependency injection) .
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): REST APIs.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/): A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil): Loading images from network.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber): A logger with a small API footprint.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
  .
- Architecture
    - The app following MVVM Clean Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model) - Domain layer - Data
      layer with Repository Pattern

- This Repository contains 3 branches
    - [First](https://github.com/nedaluof/AnimeX/tree/master) which represents master that contain
      ready base code for development.
    - [Second](https://github.com/nedaluof/AnimeX/tree/round_1/base) which represents round one of
      the development phase so
      in this round the data bumped directly from the Remote Source to the UI over
      the [Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)
      PagingSource without any caching , The next image demonstrates the flow of the process.

    - [Third](https://github.com/nedaluof/AnimeX/tree/round_2/caching) which represents round two of
      the development phase so
      in this round the data bumped directly from the database to the UI over
      the [Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)
      PagingSource Assisted
      with [Remote Mediator](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator)
      which control the process of loading new pages from the Remote Source
      and cache it on the database, so based on this flow the database become the source of truth of
      the data in the app ,the remote mediator calculate the pages based on stored AnimeXPagingKeys
      that contain:
        - nextKey -> next page number
        - prevKey -> previous page number
        - currentPage -> current page number
          <br/>
          The next image demonstrates the flow of the process
